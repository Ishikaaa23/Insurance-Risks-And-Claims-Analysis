# Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis using Power BI

This project focuses on analyzing insurance risk and claim patterns using interactive Power BI dashboards. With insurance providers managing thousands of policies and claims, visualizing claim frequency, distribution by demographics, car usage, and other factors provides actionable insights into risk assessment, customer behavior, and claim management.

## Project Overview

Insurance companies deal with a vast array of policies, covering different types of vehicles, drivers, and regions. Monitoring total claims, claim frequency, claim amounts, and customer profiles enables better risk management, pricing, and fraud detection.

The goal of this project is to use Power BI to analyze insurance claims data and provide interactive reports that help stakeholders assess risks, monitor claim trends, and make data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement

Insurance providers face challenges such as:

Handling high volumes of claims from different regions and customer groups.

Identifying high-risk drivers and vehicles.

Tracking claim amounts, frequency, and patterns.

Lack of unified reporting that integrates various risk factors.

## Solution

The dataset is analyzed and visualized in Power BI through dashboards that provide:

Claim amount distribution by car usage, age group, car make, and region.

Insights into claim frequency and average claim amount.

Risk assessment by demographic factors such as gender, education, and marital status.

Identification of trends and potential high-risk areas.

These insights help insurers enhance risk evaluation, optimize pricing models, and improve customer service.

## Stages of the Project
### 1. Exploratory Analysis

Total policies and claims.

Claim frequency and average claim amount.

Claim distribution by demographics.

Claim patterns by car make, usage, and coverage zone.

### 2. Key Insights Dashboards

Claim Amount by Car Usage – private vs. commercial vehicles.

Claim Amount by Car Make – identifying high-risk brands.

Claim by Age Group – age-wise claim patterns.

Claim by Coverage Zone – urban vs. rural trends.

Claim by Education & Marital Status – socio-economic profiling.

Claim Frequency and Average Claim – overall claim health indicators.

### 3. Risk & Performance Monitoring

Monitoring high claim amounts and frequent claims.

Spotting patterns related to high-risk customers.

Providing KPIs to track claim trends.

Insights into customer segmentation and behavior.

## Technologies and Tools Used

Visualization Tool: Power BI

Dataset: Insurance claim dataset (policies, claims, demographics)

Data Cleaning: Excel / Power Query within Power BI

Features: Filters, interactive visuals, KPI metrics, time-based charts

## Key Features

Interactive dashboards with drill-down functionality.

Real-time insights into claim distribution and frequency.

Customer segmentation by age, gender, education, and region.

Identification of high-risk claims by vehicle usage and type.

Performance tracking using KPIs and summary statistics.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Power BI dashboards can be leveraged to:

Provide a clear view of insurance claims and risk areas.

Help insurers make informed decisions based on customer and claim data.

Improve risk assessment, pricing models, and customer engagement.

Offer actionable insights for managing claims and policy portfolios.

The framework can be extended to include predictive modeling, fraud detection, and customer retention strategies for deeper analysis.
